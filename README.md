# SpaghettiCodeProject
This was my Data Structures and Algorithms program I had to create. This is one of my projects showcasing how not to design a sorting algorithm. Though creating this program I learned on when designing an algorithm to be flexible if something does not go well, change to a different design to see if the problem does not appear later on. In this program shows if you keep going on a design that does not have an end point or just using experimental code, this is generally a bad idea and go towards something that has worked in the past and build upon it, rather than re-inventing the wheel. Make sure to always plan before you code!
